Specifically, higher N : P was associated with a strong decline in GeoMean_Chla (posterior mean effect −16.24, 95 % credible interval [−23.39, −9.42]). In contrast, the smooth terms for sea‐surface temperature (−2.47 [−4.79, 0.69]), sea‐surface salinity (−0.01 [−1.72, 1.88]), total nutrient load (−1.07 [−6.49, 4.03]), mixed‐layer depth (13.84 [−24.40, 59.80]) and heat flux (−3.86 [−8.64, 0.64]) all had 95 % credible intervals overlapping zero, indicating weaker effect of these variables on chlorophyll-a in our study. Only SST and HF have a slight tendency towards a negtative effect on the Chla, having 0 included just on the edge of the distribution of there 95% credible intervals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Posterior conditional (marginal) effects of the six environmental drivers retained in the Gamma-GAM for monthly geometric-mean chlorophyll-a (Chla) in the Gulf of Lyon.

Heat flux exerts a U‐shaped influence: Chl a is lowest (~0.08 mg m⁻³) under strong negative fluxes (around –200 W m⁻²) and increases to roughly 0.18 mg m⁻³ at 0 W m⁻² before leveling off. In contrast, the N : P ratio produces a sharp drop in Chl a from nearly 0.90 mg m⁻³ at N : P≈10 down to ~0.30 mg m⁻³ by N : P≈25, beyond which values remain relatively constant around 0.20 mg m⁻³. Total nutrient concentration yields an almost flat response—Chl a hovers near 0.15 mg m⁻³ between 0 and 4500 mmol m⁻³, with only a slight uptick toward 0.20 mg m⁻³ at the highest loads. Mixed‐layer depth generates a broad peak a medium depth: Chl a rises from ~0.15 mg m⁻³ at shallow depths to a maximum of ~0.35 mg m⁻³ around 350 m of MLD and then falls back to ~0.15 mg m⁻³ by 400 m. Finally, sea‐surface salinity shows virtually no change, with Chl a remaining between 0.16 and 0.18 mg m⁻³ across the observed 37.5–38.5 ppm range."

In contrast, the smooth effect of sea‐surface salinity was essentially zero (–0.003; 95 % CI –0.55 to 0.59), the N : P ratio exhibited a small positive coefficient (0.16; 95 % CI –0.92 to 1.23), and total nutrient load showed a moderate positive estimate (1.90; 95 % CI –0.23 to 4.05)—all of which had credible intervals overlapping zero. Likewise, mixed‐layer depth (–0.81; 95 % CI –3.15 to 0.71) and surface heat flux (0.36; 95 % CI –0.66 to 1.36) failed to demonstrate a statistically discernible influence on chlorophyll‐a. The Gamma‐family shape parameter was estimated at 98.91 (95 % CI 82.56 to 116.69).

As sea‐surface temperature rises from roughly 17 °C to 28 °C, modeled Chl a falls from about 0.06 mg m⁻³ to 0.035 mg m⁻³, with the steepest decline between 17 and 22 °C before the curve levels off at warmer temperatures. Heat flux produces a classic U-shape: Chl a is near 0.042 mg m⁻³ under strong cooling (–300 W m⁻²), drops to ~0.040 mg m⁻³ around 0 W m⁻², then rises to ~0.045 mg m⁻³ by +200 W m⁻². The N : P ratio effect is more subtle, with Chl a increasing gradually from ~0.037 mg m⁻³ at an N : P of 25 to ~0.041 mg m⁻³ at N : P of 100 and a slight plateau of ~0.039 mg m⁻³ between ratios of 100–150. Total nutrient load drives a strong positive response, as Chl a climbs from ~0.028 mg m⁻³ at 0 mmol m⁻³ to ~0.04 mg m⁻³ by 50 mmol m⁻³, continues toward ~0.06 mg m⁻³ at 200 mmol m⁻³, and approaches ~0.07 mg m⁻³ at 300 mmol m⁻³. Mixed-layer depth showshave nearly no effect on chla between 0 and 75m of MLD, but a negative effect on chla can be seen when MLD is greater than 75m with chla going from 0.040 mg m⁻³at 75m to 0.030 mg m⁻³ at 175m . Finally, sea-surface salinity elicits virtually no change, with Chl a constrained between ~0.038 and ~0.040 mg m⁻³ over the 38.9–39.9 ppm range."

    "text": "Visit the Github repository\n\n\n\nStudy sites\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Map of the 3 regions investigated in this study\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 shows the three study sites considered in this work. The first, named Lyon, is located in the Gulf of Lion, between Corsica and Spain. It covers a total area of 14970 km². The Adriatic region, situated between Italy and Croatia, covers a similar area of 14945 km². The third region, Cyprus, is the smallest of the three. It is located south of the island of Cyprus and covers an area of 13352 km².\n\n\nData investigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Time Serie of Chla and environmental varibles\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 shows the variation of each response variable and of Chlorophyll-a over time, starting on 1 January 1999. Lyon is the site where Chlorophyll-a is most variable, with a minimum of 0.05 mg m⁻³ and a maximum of 1.58 mg m⁻³. On average, Lyon has a Chla concentration of 0.25 mg m⁻³, which is higher than those of the two other regions: 0.1 mg m⁻³ for Adriatic and 0.04 mg m⁻³ for Cyprus.\nLyon is also the site where the mixed-layer depth (MLD) and nutrients (NO₃, NH₄, and PO₄) show the greatest variability.\nHeat flux (HF) and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) vary in the same way regardless of region. The yearly minimum SST in Cyprus is the warmest of all three regions, and overall, the yearly maximum SST is also highest in Cyprus, although it is quite close to the maxima of the other two regions.\n\n\nColinearity of variable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Pairwise scatter plot of each variable\n\n\n\n\n\nHighly correlated covariates were removed to prevent multicollinearity, which would otherwise inflate parameter uncertainty and obscure the individual ecological effects we aim to quantify. As shown in Figure 3, PO₄ and NO₃ are almost perfectly correlated (R = 0.997). NO₃ is also strongly correlated with NH₄ (R = 0.77), and PO₄ with NH₄ (R = 0.742). Therefore, individual nutrient concentrations were excluded from the analysis. Instead, we included two derived variables:\n\\[\nNPratio = (NO3+NH4)/PO4\n\\]\n&\n\\[\nTotalNutrient = PO4+NO3+NH4\n\\] These aggregated metrics provide more interpretable and independent representations of nutrient availability and stoichiometry (Figure 4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Pairwise scatter plot of each variable after variable selection\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result of the variable selection process, chlorophyll-a concentration will be modeled as a function of sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface salinity (SSS), mixed layer depth (MLD), heat flux (HF), nutrient stoichiometry (NP ratio), and total nutrient availability (TotalNutrient).\n\n\nModel Building\nWe fitted a Bayesian Generalised Additive Model (GAM) with a Gamma response in brms (Bürkner 2017, 2018, 2021) to explain the geometric-mean chlorophyll-a concentration (GeoMean_Chla) in for each of the 3 sites (one model for each site).\nThe response (GeoMean_Chla) is strictly positive and right-skewed, therefore we adopted a Gamma distribution with a log link (See equation below). Six environmental drivers, likewise available as monthly means, were entered as thin-plate regression splines to allow non-linear effects: sea-surface temperature (SST), sea-surface salinity (SSS), the nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratio (NPratio), summed dissolved nutrients (TotalNutrient), mixed-layer depth (MLD) and the Heat flux (HF). All predictors were centred and scaled prior to modelling. Weak but regularising priors were used: Student-t(3, 0, 2.5) for the intercept, half-Student-t(3, 0, 2.5) for each smooth’s standard deviation, and Gamma(0.01, 0.01) for the Gamma shape parameter φ. Posterior inference relied on the NUTS Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo sampler with 4 chains × 10 000 iterations, discarding the first 1 000 iterations of each chain as warm-up. Convergence and sampling quality were verified by inspecting the Gelman–Rubin statistic (Rhat ≤ 1.01 for every parameter) together with bulk and tail effective sample sizes (all &gt; 5 000), confirming that the posterior was thoroughly explored and free of divergent transitions.\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathrm{GeoMean\\_Chla}_{i} &\\sim\n      \\mathrm{Gamma}\\!\\bigl(\\mu_{i}\\,\\varphi,\\;(1-\\mu_{i})\\,\\varphi\\bigr) \\\\[6pt]\n\n\\log \\mu_{i} &= \\eta_{i} \\\\[4pt]\n\n\\eta_{i} &=\n      \\alpha\n    + f_{1}(\\mathrm{SST}_{i})\n    + f_{2}(\\mathrm{SSS}_{i})\n    + f_{3}(\\mathrm{N{:}P}_{i})\n    + f_{4}(\\mathrm{SumNutri}_{i})\n    + f_{5}(\\mathrm{MLD}_{i})\n    + f_{6}(\\mathrm{HF}_{i}) \\\\[8pt]\n\nf_{j}(x) &= \\sum_{k=1}^{K_{j}} \\beta_{jk}\\,B_{jk}(x),\n\\qquad j = 1,\\dots,6 \\\\[10pt]\n\n\\alpha     &\\sim t_{3}(0,\\,2.5) \\\\[2pt]\n\\beta_{jk} &\\sim \\mathcal N\\!\\bigl(0,\\,\\sigma_{j}^{2}\\bigr) \\\\[2pt]\n\\sigma_{j} &\\sim t^{+}_{3}(0,\\,2.5) \\\\[2pt]\n\\varphi    &\\sim \\mathrm{Gamma}(0.01,\\,0.01)\n\\end{aligned}\\]"
